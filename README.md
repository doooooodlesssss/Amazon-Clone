# Amazon Clone Project

Welcome to my Amazon Clone project! ðŸš€ This is my first frontend project, created using HTML and CSS.

## About the Project

This project is a clone of the home page of the Amazon website's layout and design. It includes key features such as a navigation bar, product display cards, and a footer. The goal was to practice frontend development skills and create a visually appealing and responsive web page.
